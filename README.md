## Process: How did you go about implementing the concept. Describe your role and what your contribution was.

### Brainstorming
We began by meeting together and coming up with potential ideas. We consulted previous websites, threw out various suggestions, until we reached an idea that we like, ghosts. After that, we came up with an outline of how the comic would proceed, describing each panel. And then we decided upon the jobs that each of us would do
- Rhea and Maimuna : Working on Website Code (CSS, HTML and JavaScript)
- Moyo and Bhavicka: Designing Panels and Graphics

### Website
Maimuna's explanation for the template;

Using Maimuna's template, I then began to add the panels of the comic.

#### Rhea
We wanted to include an animation of the ghost moving a fork within the kitchen, and so I had to figure out how to add that animation using the images that were to be included. It took a while and a bit of trial and error, but I finally figured it out, using keystrokes as well as JavaScript to have the animation begin when the viewer scrolls to that section of the page. 

In addtion, to add ineractivity to the page we decided to use two buttons, so that the viewer could decide if they wanted to investigate or ignore the ghost. And so I worked on adding buttons to the website as well as ensuring that each button led to the respective "adventure" and there was no overlap between the two.  




## Reflection/Evaluation: This should bookend the initial concept and talk about whether your expectations and goals were met in the process of building the final working version.
